# OpenGL-OpenCV Changelog
This is an informal changelog for an informal project. The general format should be similar to [olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog]. This is primarily for my own record keeping. However I hope to use this as an opportunity to form good habits. Constructive feedback is encouraged.

## To-Do
* Render different types of models on different sticky notes.

## [2016-05-15]
### Additions
* GL-Squares: Renders models on multiple sticky notes.

## [2016-05-14]
### Additions
* GL-Squares: Added sample image files and ability to export screenshots.
* Compile flag STATIC\_IMAGES controls whether to capture from webcam or read images.

## [2016-05-13]
### Updates
* GL-Squares now renders an sobj model on top of a sticky note.

### Additions
* I made a model of a BB8-like droid. That is in the sobj folder.

## [2016-05-12]
### Updates
* Tried rendering OBJ files using OpenGL. Too complicated to load.
* Created a program to convert OBJ files to a space separated list of vertexes (I call them SOBJ files).

### Bugs
* SOBJ files don't seem to be rendering properly either. Need to create a simple sample and test it.

## [2016-05-11]
### Updates
* Completed work on squares. Active development is now on GL-Squares.
* GL-Squares can track a sticky note's position, scale, and rotation.

## [2016-05-08 - 2016-05-10]
### Updates
* Started repository. Contains a few older demos and squares demo.
* Squares detects the outline and center of sticky notes.
